Multiwindow test application that supports prestarting. 

Prestart support is implemented using the inheritance approach (custom application
inherited from MApplication). Used mode is M::LazyShutdownMultiWindow, so the 
application never *really* exits. Only the windows are hidden and reset.

Command to launch application using specific window (the last paramater is the 
window id to show):

dbus-send --dest=com.nokia.MultiWindow1 --type="method_call" / com.nokia.MultipleWindowsIf.launchWindow int32:"2"

Application supports 3 window id's: 1, 2 and 3.

Application can be started with the switch "-output-level debug" to get information what happens inside it.
